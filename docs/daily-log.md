# Daily Log

## Day 1 – July 19, 2025
**Project:** MyFitnessPal Clone & AI Meal Planner Agent

**Progress:**
Today, I focused on planning and defining the backend architecture for the fitness tracking application. This involved the following:

### Understanding Core Architecture:
- Structured the backend, including user authentication flow, data storage, and API design for frontend/AI agent interaction.

### Choosing Frameworks & Tools:
- FastAPI for backend (automatic validation, docs, performance)
- Supabase for hosted PostgreSQL (user accounts, macro goals, food logs, agent permissions)
- Pydantic for request validation
- JWT for authentication
- dotenv for managing credentials
- supabase-py for Python integration

### Data Modeling & Planning:
- Defined main entities: users, macro_preferences, food_logs, agent_permissions
- Planned FastAPI request validation with Pydantic
- Outlined JWT-based user data security and agent permission handling

### Documentation:
- Drafted architecture plan covering:
  - Framework/tool roles
  - Backend integration
  - API structure/security
  - Data flow (frontend → backend → Supabase)

### Next Steps:
- Build backend project directory
- Create main.py and initial auth.py for signup/login and JWT
- Set up Supabase instance and tables
- Implement API routes for macro preferences and food logs

## Day 7 – July 26, 2025
**Project:** MyFitnessPal Clone & AI Meal Planner Agent

**Progress:**
**Email Configuration & Domain Setup for Production Email Delivery**

### Email System Investigation & Configuration:
- **Identified email confirmation issues**: Users not receiving signup confirmation emails
- **Diagnosed root cause**: Supabase built-in email service limited to 2 emails/hour
- **Explored email configuration options**: Email templates vs SMTP settings
- **Discovered rate limiting problems**: "email rate limit exceeded" errors during testing

### Supabase Email Settings Analysis:
- **Email Templates**: Confirmed correctly configured with `{{ .ConfirmationURL }}` placeholder
- **SMTP Settings**: Found custom SMTP required for higher rate limits
- **Rate Limits**: Built-in service limited to 2 emails/hour (insufficient for testing)
- **Sender Verification**: Identified `nilakarthikesan@gmail.com` not verified in SendGrid

### SendGrid Integration Challenges:
- **Custom SMTP Configuration**: Attempted to use SendGrid for email delivery
- **Sender Authentication Issues**: Domain authentication required for professional setup
- **Rate Limit Configuration**: Custom SMTP needed to increase email sending limits
- **Email Delivery Problems**: "Error sending confirmation email" due to unverified sender

### Domain Setup for Professional Email:
- **Registered domain**: `macro.com` through Cloudflare
- **Set up Cloudflare account**: For DNS management and domain hosting
- **Started nameserver configuration**: Final step to activate Cloudflare DNS
- **Planned SendGrid domain authentication**: For professional email delivery

### Technical Discoveries:
- **Email Architecture**: Supabase Auth handles registration, email delivery can use built-in or custom SMTP
- **Rate Limit Differences**: Built-in service (2/hour) vs SendGrid (100/day free, then paid)
- **Domain Requirements**: Professional email setup requires domain ownership and DNS configuration
- **Testing Conflicts**: Using same email for sending and testing can cause delivery issues

### Current Status:
- **Working**: User registration, email templates, domain purchase
- **In Progress**: Cloudflare nameserver setup, SendGrid sender verification
- **Next Steps**: Complete domain configuration, verify sender, test email delivery

### Challenges Faced:
1. **Email Rate Limiting**: Built-in service too restrictive for testing
2. **SendGrid Configuration**: Sender verification and domain authentication complexity
3. **Domain Setup**: Nameserver configuration and DNS management
4. **Testing Methodology**: Need dedicated test email accounts

### Key Learnings:
- Production email delivery requires proper SMTP configuration
- Domain authentication improves email deliverability significantly
- Built-in services have limitations for production use
- Email testing requires proper sender verification and rate limit management

### Next Steps:
- [ ] Complete Cloudflare nameserver configuration
- [ ] Verify sender email in SendGrid
- [ ] Re-enable custom SMTP in Supabase
- [ ] Increase email rate limits
- [ ] Test email delivery with new configuration
- [ ] Create dedicated test email account
