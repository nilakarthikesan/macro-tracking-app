## Day 9 – July 28, 2025
**Project:** Macro Tracking App - Project Reorganization and Testing

**Progress:**
**Major Milestone: Complete Project Structure Reorganization and Backend Testing!**

### Project Reorganization (Completed):
- **Backend Restructure**: Moved `app/` directory to `backend/` for cleaner organization
- **Import Updates**: Updated all import statements from `app.` to `backend.`
- **File Structure**: Now matches frontend organization with dedicated backend folder
- **Documentation Updates**: Updated README and API docs to reflect new structure

### Backend Testing (Completed):
- **Server Startup**: Successfully tested backend on port 8001
- **Health Endpoint**: Confirmed working with `{"status":"healthy","message":"Server is running"}`
- **SendGrid Integration**: Tested email functionality successfully
- **Import Paths**: All backend imports working correctly after reorganization

### Frontend Integration (Completed):
- **API Configuration**: Updated frontend to connect to backend on port 8001
- **Connection Testing**: Frontend can communicate with reorganized backend
- **CORS Configuration**: Maintained cross-origin communication

### Technical Achievements:
- **Clean Project Structure**: 
  ```
  macro-tracking-app/
  ├── backend/          # FastAPI backend
  ├── frontend/         # React frontend
  ├── docs/            # Documentation
  └── README.md        # Project overview
  ```
- **All Import Paths Updated**: 17 files modified with correct import statements
- **Backend Functionality Verified**: Health and email endpoints working
- **Frontend-Backend Communication**: Successfully tested and working

### Challenges Faced & Solutions:

#### 1. **Port Conflicts:**
- **Problem**: Port 8000 was already in use by previous server instance
- **Solution**: Used port 8001 for testing and updated frontend configuration
- **Result**: Both servers running successfully on different ports

#### 2. **Import Path Updates:**
- **Problem**: All backend files needed import statement updates
- **Solution**: Systematically updated all `from app.` to `from backend.`
- **Result**: Clean, organized codebase with proper module structure

#### 3. **Documentation Synchronization:**
- **Problem**: README and API docs needed updates for new structure
- **Solution**: Updated all documentation to reflect backend folder and new run commands
- **Result**: Complete documentation that matches current project structure

### Current Status:
- **Backend**: Running successfully on port 8001 with all endpoints functional
- **Frontend**: Updated to connect to new backend port

## Day 8 – July 27, 2025
**Project:** Macro Tracking App - React Frontend Development

**Progress:**
**Major Milestone: React Frontend Foundation Setup with Backend Integration!**

### React App Setup (Completed):
- Created React application with TypeScript: `npx create-react-app frontend --template typescript`
- Installed essential dependencies: `react-router-dom`, `axios`, `@types/react-router-dom`
- Organized project structure with proper directories (components, services, types, utils, etc.)
- Set up development environment and configuration

### Project Structure Created (Completed):
```
frontend/src/
├── components/     ← Reusable UI components
├── pages/         ← Full page components  
├── services/      ← API communication
├── contexts/      ← Global state management
├── types/         ← TypeScript definitions
└── utils/         ← Helper functions
```

### Backend Integration Setup (Completed):
- **API Configuration** (`src/utils/api.ts`): Axios setup with interceptors for auth tokens
- **Type Definitions** (`src/types/auth.types.ts`): TypeScript interfaces for API data
- **Auth Service** (`src/services/authService.ts`): Complete API service for authentication
- **Test Component** (`src/components/BackendTest.tsx`): UI to test backend connection

### React App Successfully Running (Completed):
- **Frontend**: Running on `http://localhost:3000`
- **UI Working**: Shows "Macro Tracking App - Frontend" with test buttons
- **Component Rendering**: BackendTest component displays correctly
- **TypeScript Compilation**: Successful with no errors

### Challenges Faced & Solutions:

#### 1. **Directory Issues:**
- **Problem**: Running `npm start` from wrong directory (root instead of frontend)
- **Error**: `npm error enoent Could not read package.json: Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory`
- **Root Cause**: React app needs to be run from where `package.json` is located
- **Solution**: Navigate to `frontend/` directory before running commands
- **Result**: React development server starts successfully

#### 2. **TypeScript/ESLint Warnings:**
- **Problem**: Unused imports and default export warnings in authService.ts
- **Root Cause**: ESLint detecting unused PasswordResetRequest import
- **Solution**: Fixed by removing unused imports and changing to named export
- **Result**: Clean compilation with no warnings

#### 3. **React Server Memory Issues:**
- **Problem**: `RpcIpcMessagePortClosedError` and memory limit warnings
- **Root Cause**: TypeScript/ESLint service memory issues during compilation
- **Solution**: Killed existing processes and restarted React server cleanly
- **Result**: Server runs without memory warnings

#### 4. **Backend Connection Testing:**
- **Problem**: Frontend showing "Network Error" when testing backend connection
- **Root Cause**: Expected behavior when FastAPI backend not running
- **Solution**: Started FastAPI backend on port 8000 for testing
- **Result**: Ready to test full frontend-backend integration

### Technical Achievements:
- Complete React frontend foundation with TypeScript
- Proper project structure and organization
- Backend integration setup with Axios and interceptors
- Type-safe API communication with TypeScript interfaces
- Test component for backend connection verification
- Clean compilation and development environment

### Current Status:

- **Ready for Testing**: Backend connection and SendGrid email functionality
- **Next Phase**: Authentication UI, routing, and core feature development

### Next Steps:
- [ ] **Test Backend Connection**: Start FastAPI backend and test connection buttons
- [ ] **Build Authentication UI**: Create login/signup forms
- [ ] **Add Routing**: Set up React Router for navigation
- [ ] **Build Core Features**: Dashboard, macro goals, food logging interfaces

- **Root Cause**: SendGrid v6.11.0 changed Content object constructor syntax
- **Solution**: Updated EmailService to use `mail.content = Content(...)` instead of constructor parameter
- **Result**: Email sending works correctly with current SendGrid version

#### 2. **Virtual Environment Issues:**
- **Problem**: Corrupted pip in virtual environment preventing package installation
- **Root Cause**: Virtual environment dependency conflicts
- **Solution**: Used global Python environment with SendGrid already installed
- **Result**: Server runs successfully with email functionality

#### 3. **Email Integration Architecture:**
- **Problem**: How to integrate emails without breaking existing auth flow
- **Root Cause**: Need to maintain backward compatibility
- **Solution**: Made email sending non-blocking with try/catch in auth endpoints
- **Result**: Auth works even if email service fails

### Technical Achievements:
- Complete SendGrid email integration
- Professional email templates with HTML formatting
- Seamless integration with existing authentication system

  - total_calories (integer)
  - protein_pct (numeric)
  - carb_pct (numeric)
  - fat_pct (numeric)
  - created_at, updated_at timestamps
- **Relationships:** Proper foreign key to auth.users table
- **Constraints:** NOT NULL for required fields, proper data types
